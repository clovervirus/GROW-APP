# Repo Validation Findings (Final Handoff)

## Current State
- Local branches `main`, `feature/lighting`, `feature/environment`, and `feature/host-shell` all
  point to the latest workspace state.
- `origin` is configured to `https://github.com/clovervirus/GROW-APP.git`.
- Outbound pushes fail with `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403` because the environment lacks
  authenticated proxy access.
- `.github/workflows/pages-cdn.yml` and `.github/workflows/pages-vite.yml` live on `main` and are
  ready to run once commits reach GitHub.
- Draft PR creation and Pages smoke tests are blocked until the repository can push to GitHub.
- Run `./scripts/snapshot.sh` to regenerate this status snapshot at any time.

## Recommended Actions
1. **Preferred:** run `./scripts/create-bundle.sh` to export every branch into `artifacts/*.bundle`.
   Move the bundle to a machine with GitHub access and execute the push commands printed by the
   script (`git clone --bare`, `git pull <bundle> --all`, `git push origin --all`, `git push origin --tags`).
2. **If proxy credentials become available:** configure `http.proxy`/`https.proxy` and retry
   `git push -u origin main` followed by the feature branches.
3. **As a fallback:** manually upload the tracked files in the GitHub UI (see `docs/final-handoff.md`).

## After the Push
- Enable GitHub Pages from **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.
- Use the curl/jq snippet in `docs/final-handoff.md` to open the draft PR
  (`feature/lighting` → `main`) once a `GITHUB_TOKEN` is available.
- Smoke-test the deployed CDN app by curling the Pages URL; confirm the HTML contains
  "Grow Suite (CDN)".
- Re-run the validation snippet to confirm remote branches, then update this report with the final
  deployment status.

## Session Log — 2025-10-17
- Verified `main` fast-forwards to `work`; recreated feature branches from `main`.
- Added `origin` remote and attempted to push `main` and feature branches — blocked by `CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`.
- Generated offline bundle: `artifacts/grow-app-20251017-042839.bundle`.
- Confirmed `.github/workflows/pages-cdn.yml` exists on `main` for GitHub Pages deployment.
- Updated Host Shell UI with an Auto-send PPFD toggle and persistence.
